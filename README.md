# Strapi 3 to Strapi 4 Migration Script
This script migrates data from a Strapi 3 instance to a Strapi 4 instance, including handling relationships, media, and components.

---

## Features
- **Authentication**: Logs in to Strapi 3 using email and password, and uses an API key for Strapi 4.
- **Data Migration**: Fetches entries from a specified model in Strapi 3 and recreates them in Strapi 4.
- **Media Uploads**: Downloads media files from Strapi 3 and uploads them to Strapi 4, linking them to the correct entries.
- **Relationship Mapping**: Maps relationships between entries and updates them for Strapi 4.
- **Component Handling**: Processes nested components, including media and relationships within components.
